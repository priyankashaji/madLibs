<h1><img src="img/puppy.jpg">   Puppy Love</h1>
  <p>Today I saw him again. When he looks at me with those {{user.color}} eyes,
  it makes my {{user.bodyPart}} go pitterpat,
  and I feel as if I have {{user.nouns}} in my stomach.
  When he scrunches his nose, I want to {{user.verb}} him softly.
  He is so {{user.adjective}} and {{user.adjectives}}.
  Tomorrow he will be mine. {{user.pronoun}} love is hard to resist!
